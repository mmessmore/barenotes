// gitCmd represents the git command
var gitCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "git",
	Short: "Run git commands within the repo",
	Long: `This is a simple proxy to run git commands within the hugo repo

To pass options to git, you will need to precede them with '--' so they are
not interpreted as options to this command.  Arguments (eg "push", "commit",
and paths) do not require this.

Examples:
 barenotes git add .
 barenotes git commit -- -am "todo update"
 barenotes git push
	`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		internal.Git(args...)
	},
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(gitCmd)
}
